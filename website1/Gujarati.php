                <p class="fs-5">It is a well-known fact that the Gujarati thali has garnered much fame not just in India but also overseas. The authenticity of Gujarati foods is attributed to the distinct spices used and the unique cooking methods employed to bring on the desired fusion of flavours. In 2015, we started Food On Way with the vision of providing authentic Gujarati thali to our patrons in Ahmedabad. We started with two branches, one in Vastrapur and one in Prahlad Nagar, both specialising in delectable North Indian vegetarian fare.
                    <br>
                    A fusion of sweet, salty and spicy tastes is palpable in many of the Gujarati dishes This is accomplished by sugar or jaggery that is used in preparing some vegetable items and dal which give them a distinctly sweet flavour.

                    The hot and dry summers of this place necessitate the use of ingredients like salt, lemon, tomatoes, and sugar in preparing different dishes to avoid dehydration. The cooking techniques used in the preparation of Gujarati food lend the cuisine its unique flavour and rich aroma. Stir-frying and steam cooking along with spices is the most common cooking style followed in Gujarati cuisine. A distinct technique that enhances the flavour of Gujarati cuisine is called Vaghar. In this, a combination of select whole spices is fried in ghee or oil which is then poured into the boiled vegetables or dal.

                    Spices play a very important role in most Gujarati dishes. Food On Way strives to make its Gujarati dishes authentic by blending these spices in the right way. The commonly used spices and seasonings in Gujarati food include turmeric powder, kokum (garcinia indica), elaichi (cardamom), jeera (cumin), kothmir (coriander), aambli or aamli (tamarind), kesar (saffron), god (jaggery), methi (fenugreek seeds and leaves), pudina (mint), hing (asafoetida), laving (cloves), soonth (ginger powder), lal marchu (cayenne pepper), chaat masala, mitho limbdo (curry leaves), lilu marchu (green chilli) and garam masala ( a combination of spices roasted and powdered).
