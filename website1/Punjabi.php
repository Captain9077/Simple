                <p class="fs-5"> The moment someone mentions Punjabi food, images of tandoori dishes and the rich butter dripping naan, paneer butter masala combo are what pop up inside our minds! But Punjabi cuisine is much more bountiful and diverse. It is indeed a gastronomist’s delight! The Punjabi cuisine is a melange of Indian, Persian, Afghan and Mughlai culinary styles. Punjab is described by various names to show the richness of its cuisine- the ‘Granary of India’; India’s bread basket’; ‘The land of milk and honey’ etc. If you are looking for Punjabi food nearby Prahlad Nagar, Ahmedabad, Food On Way is the right choice. Bringing in the subtle buttery flavours from the land of five rivers, we offer the most authentic Vegetarian Punjabi fare at your doorstep. One of the salient features of Punjabi food is the diverse range of dishes that can suit any palate. The food could range from spicy to sour, and sweet to tangy and Food On Way provides that authentic experience to our patron’s craving for Punjabi food. <br>
                    The daily menus of a Punjabi household offer a mouth-watering array of dishes made distinct by simple cooking techniques, copious amounts of milk and milk products, generous amounts of desi ghee or butter or sunflower oil and special spices. Spices crushed with the traditional mortar and pestle, the tadka or the tempering, usage of brass and copper utensils, the traditional tandoor etc are what lend the Punjabi cuisine its exquisite culinary craftsmanship. In Food On Way, one can find a wide range of choices to choose from, within our Punjabi Menu. The secret to great Punjabi food lies in the main masala which consists of onion, garlic, ginger and a lot of tomatoes fried in pure ghee. The ingredients that make these dishes distinct are black carrot (kanji), mango powder (Amchur powder) and dried fenugreek leaves (Kasoori methi). We use only the best ingredients and freshly ground spices to add to the rich flavour of the dishes we serve.</p>
